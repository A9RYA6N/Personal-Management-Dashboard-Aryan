## Raising Issues üõ†Ô∏è

When raising an issue, please follow these steps to make sure it's well-defined and easy to address:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, check the existing issues to see if it has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

2. **Make the Title Clear and Concise**:  
   The title should immediately describe the problem or feature request in a few words.

3. **Provide a Screen-Recorded Video** (for UI-related issues):  
   If your issue involves a visual bug or a UI-related problem, please provide a screen-recorded video showcasing the issue. This will help us understand the problem better.

4. **Be Consistent with Code and UI/UX Styling**:
   - **Code Styling**: Please follow the coding style that is already used in the repository. Refer to existing code to understand the structure and conventions.
   - **UI/UX Styling**: If you suggest changes to the user interface, ensure consistency with the existing design. For example, if the interface color scheme uses predominantly one color (e.g., green), avoid making arbitrary changes unless absolutely necessary.

5. **Issue Assignment**:  
   - Do not request to be assigned multiple issues at once. Focus on one issue, and once your pull request (PR) is merged, you can request another issue.
